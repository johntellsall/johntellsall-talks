hey John, watched listened through your videos from about a week ago. Apologies, I had forgotten about it :smiley:

I love the material and after I figured out what you were talking aboutâ€¦ I got super interested in it.

My general feedback is that when you start the video:

* Clearly introduce yourself
* What is the topic of this video going to be about
* Why is it important?
* Who is the intended audience for this?
* Introduce the agenda for the video
* What are the goals for the video? What should folks understand after it.
* Go through some of the definitions as a refresher. What is agile? What is Scrum? What else should folks be familar with? 

Outside of that, you speak clearly and have a good voice for radio outside of that, seems very interesting and looking to seeing it in a more polished up state
